DEPLOYMENT ERROR - FIXED
================================================================================

ERROR RECEIVED:
  "The deployment is failing health checks. This can happen if the API isn't 
   responding, or doesn't respond in time. Health checks are sent to the / 
   endpoint by default and must respond with a 200 status code in a timely manner."

ROOT CAUSE:
  The root "/" endpoint was missing from main.py. Replit/Railway deployment 
  platform sends health checks to "/" and expects a 200 status code.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
  ✅ Added root "/" endpoint to main.py (line 367-373)
  
  Code added:
  ```python
  @app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
  def root():
      """Root endpoint for deployment health checks"""
      return jsonify({
          "status": "ok",
          "service": "agentic-honeypot",
          "version": "1.0"
      }), 200
  ```

VERIFICATION:
  ✅ main.py compiled successfully
  ✅ Root endpoint returns 200 status code
  ✅ Response includes status, service name, and version
  ✅ No additional dependencies required

WHAT TO DO NOW:
  1. Re-upload the updated main.py to Replit
  2. Click "Run" to restart the deployment
  3. Wait for deployment to complete
  4. Health checks will now pass
  5. Your endpoint will be live and ready

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
  After deployment completes, you should see:
  - Green checkmark on Replit deployment status
  - "Running on https://agentic-honeypot-{username}.repl.co"
  - Health checks returning 200 OK

TEST THE FIX:
  Once deployed, run:
  ```bash
  curl https://agentic-honeypot-{username}.repl.co/
  ```
  
  Expected response:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "ok",
    "service": "agentic-honeypot",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
  ```

YOUR ENDPOINT IS NOW READY FOR SUBMISSION!
